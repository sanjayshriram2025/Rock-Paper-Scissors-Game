Rock Paper Scissors Game by SanjayShriram

This is a simple and interactive Python program that lets you play the classic Rock-Paper Scissors game against the computer. The game includes multiple rounds, score tracking, and a user friendly console interface.

 Project Description

The Rock Paper Scissors Game is a fun Python application that simulates the popular hand game. It prompts the user to enter a choice (rock, paper, or scissors), then randomly generates a choice for the computer. Based on standard rules, it determines the winner, updates the score, and asks if the user wants to play again.

This project is great for beginners to learn input handling, random number generation, conditional statements, loops, and basic game logic in Python.
